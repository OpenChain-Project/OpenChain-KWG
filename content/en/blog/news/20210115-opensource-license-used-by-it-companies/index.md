## EPAM, Github Activity Ranking and License Status by Enterprise in 2020 (OSCI)

![featured-github](featured-github.png)

[EPAM](https://www.epam.com/), which develops and consults Enterprise Software, provides a ranking service called [OSCI (Open Source Contributor Index)](https://solutionshub.epam.com/osci) that measures Github usage.

Measures the contributions of members of a commercial organization using publicly available Github Committed event data. Contributions from universities, research institutes and free email providers were not included. The target is contributors who have performed more than 10 commits, and the activity score is measured by an algorithm they have studied. The algorithm is published in [OSCI Github](https://github.com/epam/OSCI).
