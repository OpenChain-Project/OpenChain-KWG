## 1. Introduction to OpenChain KWG

### KWG's Mission and Vision

The mission of OpenChain Korea Work Group (KWG) is to help all companies effectively achieve open source compliance through collaboration and sharing, which are the spirit of open source. KWG's vision aligns with the OpenChain Project, which is to build a [trustworthy software supply chain](https://openchainproject.org/featured/2024/01/05/the-openchain-project-in-2024-where-we-go-next).

### Background and History

KWG was [established with the following background](https://www.oss.kr/community_support_cm/show/9b5bc8ec-2fc2-47a1-8cd8-a10f3f99cfb4?page=8):

1. Recognition that even large corporations can be exposed to open source risks in complex software supply chains.
2. The need to improve open source management levels across all companies in the software supply chain.
3. The importance of sharing open source management know-how between companies.

KWG was [established](https://devocean.sk.com/opensource/techBoardDetail.do?ID=164691) as a subgroup of the Linux Foundation's OpenChain Project to support open source compliance for Korean companies. It officially started its activities in January 2019 with the [first meeting](https://openchain-project.github.io/OpenChain-KWG/meeting/1st/) held at LG Electronics, with open source representatives from major corporations participating.

### Major Achievements and Milestones

KWG has achieved the following major accomplishments and milestones since its establishment:

1. **Regular Meetings**: [Regular meetings](https://openchain-project.github.io/OpenChain-KWG/meeting/) are held quarterly, and offline meetings have resumed after three years following the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Strengthened Inter-company Cooperation**: Open source representatives from major companies such as LG Electronics, SK Telecom, Kakao, Hyundai Motor Company, and Samsung Electronics have participated and strengthened cooperation.
3. **Development of Open Source Management Guide**: Developed and shared a detailed [guide](https://openchain-project.github.io/OpenChain-KWG/guide/opensource_for_enterprise/) for companies to effectively manage open source.
